# Another TODO list ¬¬

How annoying is TODO lists apps? Yeah, I know. And this is just another of them.

I made this to learn more about Redux and Webpack.
Here is the great video series from Kurt Weiberth that I used as reference:

[![What is React? | React + Redux + Webpack (Part 1)](http://img.youtube.com/vi/fZKaq623y38/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZKaq623y38&index=1&list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg)
_Thank's bro! Cheers_ :beers:
